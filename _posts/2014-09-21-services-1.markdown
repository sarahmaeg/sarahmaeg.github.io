  <p class="lead">I am a Certified Laban/Bartenieff Movement Analyst (CLMA), an Ashtanga yoga teacher, and a dancer.  Through my extensive knowledge of all the components of human body movement I provide clients with movement education and therapy.  My knowledge applies to all forms of movement:  from the complex movement of athletes to the simplicity of a computer programmer sitting at a desk.  So if you have a body, it applies to you!  </p>
